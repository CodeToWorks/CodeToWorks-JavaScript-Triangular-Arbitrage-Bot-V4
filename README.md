## 📊 What is Triangular Arbitrage?

**Triangular arbitrage** involves profiting from price discrepancies between three token pairs in a closed loop. For example:

> Token A → Token B → Token C → Token A

If the ending amount of Token A is higher than the starting amount (after accounting for gas and slippage), a profit can be captured.
